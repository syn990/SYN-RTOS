# SYN-RTOS = 'Syntax Real-Time Operating System'.

SYN-RTOS is a specialized operating system built using the ArchISO project, designed to provide advanced users with an efficient and customizable system. It offers by default a comprehensive list of modifications and additions aimed at improving performance and functionality, making it an ideal starting point for users who want to learn Arch Linux and system administration.

The project provides the necessary files and build scripts to construct a live system, streamlining the setup of a customized environment and leveraging the Arch Linux infrastructure, documentation, and development as a stable base. The ISO, combined with the provided 'profile' for Archiso, will build the latest system image according to the mirrors detected by Reflector.

While this system is not for the faint of heart and requires at an understanding of or willingness to use Linux, it is a well-constructed template that provides a strong foundation for users to build their own system and learn Arch Linux from scratch. By using SYN-RTOS as a starting point, users can quickly start their journey towards becoming proficient in Arch Linux and system administration.

Please note that the use of this system still requires a certain level of technical skill and understanding, and comes with a warning to "Use at your own risk".

In other words: 

This version of Arch Linux is designed with a focus on customization and documentation, serving as a reference for others looking to set up their own system. The clear documentation provides step-by-step instructions for setup and configuration, and the implementation is fully modifiable to meet specific needs.
