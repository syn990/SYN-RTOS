# SYN-RTOS - Syntax990 Real-Time Operating System.
This Repo serves as a place to store and manage the source tree, as it's getting quite messy!

Currently there are two main scripts: (these will later be merged into a single script. It can't seem to run arch-chroot without stopping... this halts step two.) 

- README.md # It's this readme.
- syn-installer0.sh # part one ~ Setup partitions, pacstrap packages and generate fstab.
- syn-installer1.sh # part two ~ Customize configration files, create users and enable services.

It's possible once the main and future-xibo* branches are complete these script will: 
- Be simple to clone the main branch to make changes to the installer script before running it.
- Have a clear folder structure so copying configuration files is easier to intergrate into the script.
- Have more variation in the deployment tasks being crafted.
- Provide a basic framework for creating other meta-distrobutions
 

The folders included are currenty not required at all for SYN-RTOS.

# /default-dotfiles
