# SYN-RTOS - Syntax990 Real-Time Operating System.
This Repo serves as a place to store and manage the source tree, as it's getting quite messy!

Currently there are two main scripts: (these will later be merged into a single script. It can't seem to run arch-chroot without stopping... this halts step two.) 

- syn-installer0.sh # part one -- Setup partitions, pacstrap packages and generate fstab.
- syn-installer1.sh # part two -- Customize configration files, create users and enable services.
