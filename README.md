# SYN-RTOS = 'Syntax Real-Time Operating System'.

SYN-RTOS is a specialized operating system built on top of the ArchISO project, designed to provide advanced users with an efficient and customizable system. It offers a comprehensive list of modifications and additions aimed at improving performance and functionality, making it an ideal starting point for users who want to learn Arch Linux and system administration.

The project provides the necessary files and build scripts to construct a live system, streamlining the setup of a customized environment and leveraging the Arch Linux infrastructure, documentation, and development as a stable base. This makes it easier for users to get straight into learning Arch Linux without spending hours in a terminal or reading through wikis.

While this system is not for the faint of heart and requires a deep understanding of Arch Linux and system administration, it is a well-constructed template that provides a strong foundation for users to build their own system and learn Arch Linux from scratch. By using SYN-RTOS as a starting point, users can quickly start their journey towards becoming proficient in Arch Linux and system administration.

Please note that the use of this system still requires a certain level of technical skill and understanding, and comes with a warning to "Use at your own risk".
