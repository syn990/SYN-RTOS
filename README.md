# SYN-RTOS - Syntax990 Real-Time Operating System.
This Repo serves as a place to store and manage the source tree, as it's getting quite messy!

Currently there are two scripts: 

- syn-installer0.sh # part one -- can be run so long as the machine has internet access
- syn-installer1.sh # part two -- can be run assuming you use "arch-chroot /mnt" and can run the scripts from within a chroot.
