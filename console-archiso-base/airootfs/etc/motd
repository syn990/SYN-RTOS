To install [38;2;23;147;209mSYN-RTOS[0m please contact directly using "william@syntax990.com":
Find the build materials here: https://github.com/syn990/syn-rtos.git

For Wi-Fi, authenticate to the wireless network using the [35miwctl[0m utility.
For mobile broadband (WWAN) modems, connect with the [35mmmcli[0m utility.
Ethernet, WLAN and WWAN interfaces using DHCP should work automatically.

You will then need to setup stage zero. This script may be called syn-installer0.sh
Or even syn-stage0.sh and it's goal is to nuke whatever drives detected and dump a bunch
Of packages and setup the genfstab. You can modify the pacstrap lists but anything else
Might not be useful at this stage.

Currently the dotfiles need to be copied to the user, and the second script which may be called
syn-installer1.sh should be modified as it contains variables and stuff that determine the result system.

Finally, the second script currently sets bootctl as the bootloader, and requires manual creation of the .conf's
in the EFI directory. You can ommit this line and build your own bootloader from scratch. This needs work...
